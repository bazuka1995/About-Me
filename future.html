                I have finished my Business degree with a major in Finance and just need to finish off my IT degree.
                Hopefully I will finish that soon so that I can go out into the real world.
            </p>

                I think I am going to go into computing/IT rather than business as I like that more, even though finance
                was really good and I enjoyed that a lot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since one of my hobbies is photography, design and photoshop, I might combine my IT knowledge with
                design and go into game development.
